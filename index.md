I think she knows Arabic however I look forward to meeting Freedom and inviting you into my life with her like I did with Muna and Sartu, These ladies not going anywhere, they making music with your mom and I just need to stay up till the porno people let them be free to choose their own partner and play the fallback game with my Ethnic_Cleansing and Economic_Assasination. I can barely get a computer at the libray... Someone forced RhaHels torchure porn on me and I found her in a very dangerous place in the metro. Its a scary time for our Family Quxube know it. Listen to this Donald Gover song... Your mom and I's relationship had a similar vibe. Being from georgia, a lot of the women in Oakland are prostituted at young ages so the lure boys from Georgia into relationships to get out... Shaakira and Onika are the only people in my divine harem that did not have princess peach syndrome... Maybe Muna, I gotta ask her someday. Soundcloud hide my comments sometimes. You Matt stalkers are there as well. Like that comment where he said Im feeding Erika hot garbage under an INSTAGRAM named Pale_Faced_Goon... Anyway my darling im just checking in. That Skate park on Pacific_LBC is ILL_AS_FUCK!!! THey got a halfpipe. I wanted to ride a halfpipe all my life and finnaly found one in the wild without Social networking, prostitution, or even the internet.

# WHO iS iCE?
### U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement
ICE was created in 2003 through a merger of the investigative and interior enforcement elements of the former U.S. Customs Service and the Immigration and Naturalization Service. ICE now has more than 20,000 law enforcement and support personnel in more than 400 offices in the United States and around the world.

The agency has an annual budget of approximately $8 billion, primarily devoted to three operational directorates ‚Äî Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) and Office of the Principal Legal Advisor (OPLA). A fourth directorate ‚Äì Management and Administration (M&A) ‚Äì supports the three operational branches to advance the ICE mission.

What is Doxing?
Doxing (or doxxing) is the [action](https://www.thefire.org/research-learn/doxxing-free-speech-and-first-amendment) or process of collecting and disseminating someone‚Äôs personal information in order to shame, embarrass, expose or intimidate them. This information can come from private sources but is often obtained from public records. The term derives from the phrase ‚Äúdropping dox (documents)‚Äù and describes a tactic that has evolved into a form of online harassment that can escalate into stalking or other criminal conduct.

# Writing mathematical expressions
Use Markdown to display mathematical expressions on GitHub. [GitHubDoc](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions)
`**The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**`\
$$\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)$$

**The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**

```math
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)+
This expression uses `\$` to display a dollar sign: $`\sqrt{\$4}`$
```

# $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$
## $ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $
$$\begin{eqnarray}
x' &=& &x \sin\phi &+& z \cos\phi \\
z' &=& - &x \cos\phi &+& z \sin\phi \\
\end{eqnarray}$$

A container is simply an isolated process with all of the files it needs to run. If you run multiple containers, they all share the same kernel, allowing you to run more applications on less infrastructure.
